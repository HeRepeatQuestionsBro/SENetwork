## Percentage width child in absolutely positioned parent doesn't work in IE7

I've got an absolutely positioned div containing several children, one of which is a relatively positioned div. When I use a percentage-based width on the child div, it collapses to zero width on IE7, but not on Firefox or Safari. If I use pixel width, it works. If the parent is relatively positioned, the percentage width on the child works. Is there something I'm missing here? Is there an easy fix besides the pixel-based width on the child? Is there an area of the CSS spec that covers this?
