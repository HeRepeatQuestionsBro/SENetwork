# Revision 1:

I'm new to C#, and I want to use a trackbar for the forms opacity
This is my code

    decimal trans = trackBar1.Value / 5000
    this.Opacity = trans

When I try to build it, I get this error

**Cannot implicitly convert type 'decimal' to 'double**

I tried making trans a double, but then the control doesn't work. This code worked fine for me in VB.NET. Any suggestions?
