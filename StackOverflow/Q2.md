# Revision 1
## Decimal vs Double?

I'm new to C#, and I want to use a trackbar for the forms opacity
This is my code

    decimal trans = trackBar1.Value / 5000
    this.Opacity = trans

When I try to build it, I get this error

**Cannot implicitly convert type 'decimal' to 'double**

I tried making trans a double, but then the control doesn't work. This code worked fine for me in VB.NET. Any suggestions?

## When setting a form's opacity should I use a decimal or double?

I'm new to C#, and I want to use a trackbar to change a form's opacity.

This is my code:

    decimal trans = trackBar1.Value / 5000

When I try to build it, I get this error:

I tried making `trans` a double, but then the control doesn't work. This code worked fine for me in VB.NET. 

What do I need to do differently?
