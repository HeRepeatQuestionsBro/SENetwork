## Decimal vs Double?

I'm new to C#, and I want to use a trackbar for the forms opacity
This is my code

    decimal trans = trackBar1.Value / 5000
    this.Opacity = trans

When I try to build it, I get this error

**Cannot implicitly convert type 'decimal' to 'double**

I tried making trans a double, but then the control doesn't work. This code worked fine for me in VB.NET. Any suggestions?

> Cannot implicitly convert type `decimal` to `double`

I have tried using `trans` and `double` but then the `Control` doesn't work. This code worked fine in a past VB.NET project.

## How to set the form's opacity from a decimal value into a double?

So I'm building an app using C# and I want to use a `Track-Bar` to change a `Form`'s opacity.

This is my code that I'm dealing with:

```c#
decimal trans = trackBar1.Value / 5000;
this.Opacity = trans;
```

When I build the application, it gives the following error:

> Cannot implicitly convert type `decimal` to `double`

I have tried using `trans` and `double` but then the `Control` doesn't work. This code worked fine in a past VB.NET project.

Is there anything I'm doing wrong here?
